# Neighborhood Map Project

The Neighborhood Map Project is the 9th project of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Progam. Using React and a map API 
of our choice (google-maps-react was used in this project), we are required to build a single page app that loads a map
of a place we choose with some markers. When clicking on a marker, additional information are fetched from another API
(flickr) and are displayed in an infoWindow.

## Installation and Launch

1. To install the application clone this git repository

```
https://github.com/avnikolaou/NeighborhoodMap.git
```

2. Go into the application folder

```
$ cd MyReads
```

3. Install dependencies using `npm` command line tool

```
$ npm install
```

4. Run the application, again using `npm`

```
$ npm start
```

**This will open a new browser tab/window with the application running.**

**Note that the ServiceWorker is functionable only in the production build.**

## Dependencies

1. Project was created with 'create-react-app'
2. The map was loaded using the 'google-maps-react' library.
3. The flickr API was used to fech photos.
